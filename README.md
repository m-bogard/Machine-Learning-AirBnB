 - Project Name: Machine-Learning-AirBnB
 - Team members: Carlee Peterson and MeKenzi Bogard
 - Summary: We are attemping to create a Machine Learning model to predict prices of AirBnBs within Portland, Oregon. We want to create models for each neighborhoods.
 - Problem Statement: What features correlate to AirBnB prices?
 - Databases: Insider AirBnB (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
 - Tools/Packages:
    - python=3.8
    - geopandas
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - jupyter
    - scikit-learn
- We plan to use a similar method to what we did in lab 5. We plan to train a machine learning model to predict prices for AirBnB. Use the method of randomforest regressor for our machine learning we will reduce the error. Reducing the error creates a better model at predicting the prices. 
- We expect that using multiple models based on the neighborhoods will create the lowest error.
